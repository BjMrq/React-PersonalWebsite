export const airflowProjectText = (<p className="cardText ongoingText"><strong className="blueTitle">> A data pipeline to automate our reporting:</strong> Working as a digital marketing specialist there is a lot of reporting to be done, especially if you are in charge of multiple clients. To make this reporting easier I Learned Python and used Apache Airflow to build a data pipeline.
  <br />
The first part of the pipeline connects to different APIs (Google Ads/Facebook/Google Analytics/CRM)  to get the data I need for my reporting. The data is then sent to a Big Query data warehouse. The second part of the pipeline use Pandas to process the data from different sources to get some useful insights. The result is sent by email.
  <br />
To make the development of this app easier I used Docker so I can Docker-compose my app anywhere.

export const shareInProjectText = (<p className="cardText ongoingText"><strong className="blueTitle">> Meet people that share the same interests as you:</strong> After having successfully build a data pipeline to automate our reporting I realised that I was having more fun develloping and coding than building maketing campaigns.
  <br />
I already Learned Javascript and Python on my own, now it was time to practice my coding skills with a team. The Wagon offered me the opportunity to do just that.
  <br />
My project was selected as a final project, so we went on building an app that would bring people together depending on their cultural interest. With a build in instant messagerie using websockets.

The project was a data visualisation tool for physical rehabilitation professinals.
  <br />
I learned the React framwork to plug to our rails app. Allowing me to quickyl build our first MVP.
Our app was suppose to leaverage all the data entered by the professional using AI.
