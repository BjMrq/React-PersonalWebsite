    At the end of Le Wagon bootcamp one of the students came to me: his idea has been accepted to the Centech's Acceleration program and he offers me to be the CTO of the project.
    <br />
    The project was a data visualisation tool for physical rehabilitation professionals. I learned the React framework to plug to our rails app, allowing me to quickly build our first MVP.
    <br />
    In the future, the vision of the app is to leverage all the data entered by the professional using AI. This is why and where I started learning Machine Learning...

    After having successfully build a data pipeline to automate our reporting, I realised that I was having more fun developing and coding than building marketing campaigns. I already Learned Javascript and Python on my own, now it was time to practice my coding skills with a team.
    <br />
    The Wagon offered me the opportunity to do just that. My project was selected as a final project. We built an app that would bring people together depending on their cultural interest. The app included a built in instant messagerie using websockets.

    Working as a digital marketing specialist, I had a lot of reporting to do, especially because I was in charge of multiple clients. To make this reporting easier, I Learned Python and used Apache Airflow to build a data pipeline
    <br />
    The first part of the pipeline connects to different APIs (Google Ads/Facebook/Google Analytics/CRM)  to get the data I need for my reporting. The data is then sent to a Big Query data warehouse. The second part of the pipeline use Pandas to process the data from different sources to get some useful insights. The result is sent by email.
    <br />
    To make the development of this app easier I used Docker so I can Docker-compose my app anywhere.
